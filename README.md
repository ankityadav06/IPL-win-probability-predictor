🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: IPL Win Probability Predictor! 🏏

As a Data Science enthusiast, I’ve always been fascinated by how data can transform our understanding of sports. In my latest project, I developed a machine learning model that predicts the win probability of IPL matches.

🔍 Project Overview:
The IPL Win Probability Predictor leverages various features, such as team performance, match conditions, and historical data, to estimate the chances of a team winning a match.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python for data manipulation and model development
Pandas and NumPy for data analysis
Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms
Streamlit for creating an interactive web application
Matplotlib for data visualization
📊 Key Features:
User-friendly interface to input match details such as teams, target score, current score, overs completed, and wickets lost.
Real-time probability prediction based on the provided inputs.
Visualizations to track the match's progress and understand win/lose probabilities.
🎯 Goal:
This project aims to provide cricket fans with insights into match dynamics, helping them make informed predictions during IPL games.

I’m looking forward to improving this model further and exploring more advanced techniques to enhance accuracy. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
